# Config Properties for coa-renderer.js

The refactored coa-renderer.js module is self-contained in terms of configuration and does not require any properties to be passed in a config object.

Notes
All necessary parameters and definitions are derived directly from the coa (Coat of Arms) object that is passed as a primary argument to the render function. This module has no dependency on UI settings or external configuration values.
