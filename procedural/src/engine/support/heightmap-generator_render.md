# Removed Rendering/UI Logic

The following DOM/browser-dependent code was completely removed:
- **fromPrecreated() function** - Created DOM canvas and image elements, used document.createElement(), canvas context manipulation, and image loading
- **Canvas manipulation code** - canvas.width/height, ctx.drawImage(), ctx.getImageData()
- **Image loading logic** - new Image(), img.src, img.onload event handling
- **DOM element removal** - canvas.remove(), img.remove()

## Future Work Required

The `fromPrecreated()` function has been replaced with a placeholder that throws an error. To make this work in a headless environment, the following will be needed:

1. **Image Loading Utility** - A `utils.loadImage()` function that can load PNG files in any JavaScript environment
2. **Image Processing Library** - For Node.js environments, a library like the `canvas` package to process image data
3. **Refactored getHeightsFromImageData()** - This function needs to be updated to work with headless image processing
4. **Environment Detection** - Logic to determine whether to use browser APIs or Node.js alternatives

Currently, attempting to generate heightmaps from precreated PNG files will throw an error indicating this functionality requires further implementation.
