# Removed Rendering/UI Logic from military-generator.js

## Analysis Result: No Rendering Logic Found

After thorough analysis of the military-generator.js module, **no rendering or UI logic was identified that needed to be removed**. 

The module is purely computational and focuses on:
- Calculating military units and regiments based on population, diplomacy, and geographic factors
- Processing state-level military configurations and modifiers
- Generating regiment data structures with composition and positioning information
- Creating notes for regiments

**No code blocks were removed** because the module does not contain:
- DOM manipulation (no `d3.select`, `document.getElementById`, etc.)
- SVG element creation
- HTML content generation
- UI event handling
- Rendering operations

The module was already well-architected as a pure data processing engine, making it suitable for headless operation without modification of its core computational logic.
