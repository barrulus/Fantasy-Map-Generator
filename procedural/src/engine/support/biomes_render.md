# biomes.js render requirements

After analyzing the original biomes.js code, no rendering or UI logic was found to remove. The module contains only:

- Data structure definitions (biome names, colors, matrices)
- Pure computational logic for biome assignment
- Mathematical calculations for moisture and temperature

The original module was already focused purely on data generation without any DOM manipulation, SVG rendering, or UI interactions.
