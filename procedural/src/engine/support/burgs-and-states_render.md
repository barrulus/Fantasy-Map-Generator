# Burgs and States Module - Removed Rendering/UI Logic

After analyzing the original `burgs-and-states.js` code, **no rendering or UI logic was found to remove**. 

## Analysis Results

The module contains only:

- **Data structure generation** (burgs, states arrays)
- **Pure computational logic** for placement algorithms
- **Mathematical calculations** for state expansion and diplomacy
- **Statistical calculations** for population and area
- **Algorithmic processing** for territorial assignment

## No Rendering Logic Found

The original module was already focused purely on data generation without any:

- ❌ DOM manipulation (no `d3.select`, `document.getElementById`, etc.)
- ❌ SVG rendering (no path creation, element styling, etc.)  
- ❌ Canvas drawing operations
- ❌ HTML element creation or modification
- ❌ CSS style manipulation
- ❌ UI event handling

## Module Characteristics

This module represents a **pure computational engine** that:

1. **Receives data** (`pack`, `grid`) as input
2. **Applies algorithms** for territorial and settlement generation
3. **Returns structured data** for use by rendering systems
4. **Contains no visual output** or DOM dependencies

The separation of concerns was already well-maintained in the original codebase for this particular module, requiring only the removal of global state dependencies and DOM-based configuration reading.
