# Removed Rendering/UI Logic from provinces-generator.js

## Analysis Result:

**No rendering or UI logic was found in the original `provinces-generator.js.js` file.**

The original module was purely computational and contained:
- Province generation algorithms
- Geographic calculations
- Data structure manipulations
- Mathematical computations for province boundaries

## What was NOT present (and therefore not removed):
- No DOM manipulation code
- No SVG rendering logic
- No `d3.select()` calls for visualization
- No `document.getElementById()` calls for DOM updates
- No HTML element creation or modification
- No CSS styling operations
- No canvas or WebGL rendering code

## Note:
This module was already well-separated in terms of concerns - it focused purely on the computational aspects of province generation without any visualization or user interface components. The only UI-related code was the single DOM read (`byId("provincesRatio").value`) which has been converted to a config property (`config.provincesRatio`).
