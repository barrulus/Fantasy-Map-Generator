# Removed Rendering/UI Logic from zones.js

## Analysis Result

**No rendering or UI logic was found in the original zones.js module.**

The original code was purely focused on data generation and did not contain any:

- DOM manipulation code
- SVG rendering logic  
- `d3.select()` calls for rendering
- `document.getElementById()` or similar DOM access
- Creation of HTML/SVG elements
- Direct UI updates or modifications

## Code Characteristics

The zones.js module was already well-separated in terms of concerns:

- **Data Generation Only**: The module exclusively generates zone data structures
- **No DOM Dependencies**: No direct browser/DOM dependencies were present
- **Pure Logic**: All functions perform calculations and return data objects
- **No Side Effects**: Functions don't modify DOM or trigger rendering

## Conclusion

Since no rendering logic was present in the original module, no code blocks needed to be removed for the Viewer application. The module was already appropriately focused on its core responsibility of generating zone data.
