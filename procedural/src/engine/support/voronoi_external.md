# External Dependencies for voronoi.js

The refactored `voronoi.js` module has **no external dependencies** beyond standard JavaScript.

## Analysis:
- The Voronoi class is a pure computational module that works with geometric algorithms
- It only depends on:
  - Standard JavaScript Math functions
  - Array methods (map, filter)
  - Basic data structures (arrays, objects)
- No imports from other modules are required
- The Delaunator instance is passed as a constructor parameter, not imported

## Constructor Dependencies:
The Voronoi class expects to receive:
- `delaunay`: A Delaunator instance (passed from calling code)
- `points`: Array of coordinate pairs
- `pointsN`: Number of points

These are injected dependencies, not module imports.
