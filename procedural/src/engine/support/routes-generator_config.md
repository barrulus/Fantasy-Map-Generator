# Configuration Properties for routes-generator.js

After analyzing the original `routes-generator.js` code, **no DOM-based configuration parameters were found**. 

The module does not contain any `byId()` calls or direct DOM reads that would require configuration properties.

All configuration is done through:
- Constants defined at the module level (ROUTES_SHARP_ANGLE, MIN_PASSABLE_SEA_TEMP, etc.)
- Data passed in through function parameters (pack, grid, lockedRoutes)
- Utility functions passed through the utils object

Therefore, no `config` object properties need to be defined for this module.

## Constants Used (Internal to Module)
- `ROUTES_SHARP_ANGLE = 135`
- `ROUTES_VERY_SHARP_ANGLE = 115`
- `MIN_PASSABLE_SEA_TEMP = -4`
- `ROUTE_TYPE_MODIFIERS` object with water type modifiers

These are hardcoded constants and do not require external configuration.
