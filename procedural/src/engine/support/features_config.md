# Configuration Properties for features.js

## Analysis Results

After thorough analysis of the original `features.js` code, **no DOM-based configuration parameters were found**.

The original module does not contain any `byId()` calls or direct DOM reads that would need to be replaced with `config` object properties.

## Configuration Object Structure

The `config` object passed to the features module functions should contain:

```javascript
const config = {
  // Timing and debugging
  TIME: boolean,        // Enable/disable console timing logs
  
  // Randomization
  seed: string|number,  // Random seed for reproducible generation
  aleaPRNG: function    // Pseudo-random number generator function
};
```

## Notes

- This module is purely computational and operates entirely on the provided data structures
- All configuration is derived from the input `grid` and `pack` objects or calculated dynamically
- No user interface input values are required for this module's operation
- The module focuses on geometric and topological analysis of map features rather than user-configurable parameters

## Comparison with Other Modules

Unlike modules such as `burgs-and-states.js` which read values like `statesNumber` from the DOM, the `features.js` module:
- Does not read any DOM elements
- Does not require user input parameters
- Operates purely on mathematical calculations and data structure analysis
- Uses only internally calculated constants and thresholds
