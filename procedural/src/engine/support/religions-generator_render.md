# Removed Rendering/UI Logic from religions-generator.js

## Analysis Result

**No rendering or UI logic was found in the original religions-generator.js module.**

The original code was purely computational and focused on:

1. **Data Generation**: Creating religion data structures
2. **Algorithm Logic**: Implementing religion placement, expansion, and naming algorithms  
3. **Data Transformation**: Processing and organizing religion data
4. **State Management**: Managing religion relationships and properties

## What Was NOT Removed

The code contained **zero** instances of:
- DOM manipulation (no `document.getElementById`, `innerHTML`, etc.)
- SVG rendering (no `d3.select`, path creation, etc.)
- UI updates (no element styling, class additions, etc.)
- Browser-specific APIs

## Conclusion

This module was already well-separated in terms of concerns - it handled pure data generation logic without any rendering responsibilities. The refactoring focused entirely on:

- Converting from IIFE to ES modules
- Replacing DOM-based configuration reads with config parameters  
- Implementing dependency injection for global state access
- Making functions pure by returning new data instead of mutating globals

No rendering logic needed to be extracted to a separate viewer component.
