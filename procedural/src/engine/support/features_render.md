# Removed Rendering/UI Logic from features.js

## Analysis Results

After thorough analysis of the original `features.js` code, **no DOM manipulation or SVG rendering logic was found**.

## What Was Analyzed

The analysis looked for the following types of rendering/UI code:
- `d3.select()` calls for DOM manipulation
- `document.getElementById()` or similar DOM queries
- Direct DOM element creation (e.g., creating `<path>` elements)
- SVG rendering commands
- Direct DOM property assignments (e.g., `element.innerHTML = ...`)
- Canvas drawing operations

## Findings

The `features.js` module is purely computational and contains:
- Mathematical calculations for distance fields
- Geometric analysis of map features (islands, lakes, oceans)
- Data structure operations and transformations
- Feature classification and property assignment

## No Rendering Logic Removed

**No code blocks were removed** from the original module because:
- The module does not contain any rendering or DOM manipulation code
- All functionality is related to data processing and analysis
- The module operates entirely on data structures without visual output

## Viewer Application Responsibilities

Since no rendering logic was present in the original module, the Viewer application will need to implement its own rendering logic for:
- Visualizing the calculated distance fields
- Rendering feature boundaries and classifications
- Displaying feature properties and labels
- Creating SVG paths for islands, lakes, and ocean features

## Module Purity

This module exemplifies the ideal separation of concerns where:
- **Engine**: Pure computational logic (this module)
- **Viewer**: All rendering and visualization (to be implemented separately)

The refactored module maintains this separation by focusing exclusively on data generation and analysis.
