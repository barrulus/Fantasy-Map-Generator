# Config Properties for fonts.js

## Config Properties Identified: None

The original `fonts.js` module did **not contain any DOM reads** that required configuration properties.

## Analysis

The original code had the following characteristics:
- No `byId()` calls to read DOM input values
- No configuration parameters read from UI elements
- All font data was hardcoded in the fonts array
- Functions operated on provided data parameters rather than reading global configuration

## Notes

- The refactored module is purely data-driven and functional
- All necessary data is passed as function parameters (e.g., `svgData` in `getUsedFonts()`)
- No configuration object is needed for this module
- The module provides utility functions that work with any font data provided to them
