# Config Properties for voronoi.js

The refactored `voronoi.js` module requires **no config properties**.

## Analysis:
- The Voronoi class is a pure geometric computation module
- It does not read any values from the DOM (no `byId()` calls found)
- It does not access any global configuration variables
- All necessary data is passed through constructor parameters:
  - `delaunay`: Delaunator instance
  - `points`: Array of coordinate pairs  
  - `pointsN`: Number of points

## No Configuration Needed:
Since this module performs purely geometric calculations based on input data and does not interact with UI elements or global state, no `config` object is required for this refactoring.
