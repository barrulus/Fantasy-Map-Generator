# Biomes Module - Configuration Properties

The refactored `biomes.js` module does not require any configuration properties from DOM elements.

## Analysis

After careful examination of the original `biomes.js` code, no instances of the following patterns were found:

- `byId()` calls to read DOM values
- Direct DOM element access
- Configuration parameters read from UI elements

## Config Object

The `config` parameter is included in the function signature for consistency with the refactoring pattern, but no properties are currently needed:

```javascript
export function define(pack, grid, config, utils) {
  // config parameter available but not used in this module
}
```

## Notes

- The biomes module operates purely on data structures (`pack` and `grid`)
- All configuration is embedded within the module's default data
- No external configuration parameters are required
- The module is self-contained regarding biome generation logic
